# ESP8266-as-SoftAP
NodeMCU has an ability to create a WiFi network without an internet connection. By leveraging this capability, devices can connect to NodeMCU's network and exchange data without the need for internet access. This feature opens up a range of possibilities for creating IoT applications in situations where internet access is limited or unavailable. With NodeMCU's WiFi network capabilities, developers can create innovative solutions that leverage the power of connected devices, regardless of their location or connectivity constraints.

This script sets up an access point (AP) using NodeMCU, allowing devices to connect to it and access a web page hosted on the NodeMCU device. The script includes necessary libraries such as ESP8266WiFi, WiFiClient, and ESP8266WebServer. The script defines the SSID (name) and password of the AP, which can be customized by changing the values of "APSSID" and "APPSK" respectively. The handleRoot function defines the content of the web page, which displays a message when the user accesses the root URL http://192.168.4.1 on their web browser. The setup function configures the access point and starts the HTTP server, while the loop function waits for incoming client requests and handles them using the server object.
